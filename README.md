My portfolio website (in progress)

## Notes

Right now I'm just experimenting with different concepts for my website. It is possible that I'll entirely abandon this current landing page with the expandable nav menu and try something else, but until then I'm building on top of it

## To-do

- add fancy transitions for the nav menu appearing and disappearing
- add and fill in the pages the nav items refer to
- add GitHub, YouTube, Vimeo, and LinkedIn icon links along edges of landing page
- add summary and direction to mouseover my name

## Finished

- Create basic landing page
- Make nav menu appear when you mouseover over my name and disappear when you mouseout of my name and all nav items
